go-play
=======

Go "project" for horsing around in Go.

GOPATH
------

This directory follows the prescribed Go directory structure, not that I'm a big
fan of it. But it seems to be the way these things should be run.

Therefore to build all the "main" programs in this "project", set the GOPATH
variable to (include) the folder in which this README resides.
